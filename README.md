The @wordpress/script package can compile your code using *build* just once, or you can use *start* to run a watcher in terminal. In order to use this scripts you have to edit the *package.json* file just generated

	...
		"scripts": {
			"start": "wp-scripts start",
			"build": "wp-scripts build"
		},
	...

To use the scripts just run 
	npm run start
for development mode, or 
	npm run build
for package build.

## 3. Install packages
Now it's time to install necessary packages. Run
		
	npm install --save-dev --save-exact @wordpress/scripts @wordpress/i18n


## 4. Create the entrypoint
Now you can start writing your code editing [index.js](src/index.js) in src folder
